2. Hardened and Non-hardened keys refer to different derivation methods in HD wallets;
they both use a derivation index.
Non-Hardened Keys (Normal Derivation)
- Symbol: regular index number, e.g., m/0/1/2
- Can derive public keys independently; you can derive child public keys from a
parent public key without needing the private key.
- Use case: useful when you want to generate receiving addresses on a
watch-only wallet or public server
- Risk: if a child’s private key is compromised and the parent's public key is known,
an attacker can derive the parent’s private key and all the sibling keys
Hardened Keys (Hardened Derivation)
- Symbol: Apostrophe or ‘h’ after number (e.g., m/44’/0’/0’ or m/44h/0h/0h)
- Requires private key: You must have the parent private key to derive child keys
- Use cases: Used for account-level separation and security-critical derivations
- Security: If a child private key is compromised, the parent private key remains
safe

3. Why should a wallet developer prefer deterministic wallets over non-deterministic
wallets
In a deterministic wallet;
- One backup covers infinite keys
- Users can't lose funds due to missed backups
- Compatible with modern standards (BIP32/39/44)
- Enables advanced features (watch-only, multisig, hardware wallets)
- Better UX - users only manage a seed phrase
- Industry standard - what users expect
